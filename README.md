## Details
- Auto team join
  - On joining players will automatically be added to a team. There is only one team.
- Group level sharing
  - All players on the server are kept at the same level. Upon joining all players will gradually gain levels until they are the same level as the highest level player. When a player levels, all players will gain a level to match up with that player.
- No pipe guns
  - We don't like how easy it is for everyone to be running around with guns so we removed pipe guns
- No craftable guns
  - Guns are too common. By removing the ability to craft them we are hoping that increases their value and makes looting more desirable.
- No repair packs and broken items are destroyed
  - By removing repair packs, we are hoping that using your item is a more deliberate choice.
- New Zombie Tracker skill added to perception tree
  - We just thought this was cool
- Jeep can now seat 6 people
  - Our play group is 5-6 people so we wanted a vehicle that works for us.
- A19 farming changes (Syco54645 mod)
  - A20 farming has some changes that are pain, this reverses those.
- Zombie death is ambiguous (Roland's Improved Death Ambiguity Mod updated to A20)
  - This one sounded like it was fun...and it is...but early on it just leads to beating zombies while they are on the ground...we might have to adjust this


## Inspiration
- Darkness Falls Mod
